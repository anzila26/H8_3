# 🎉 Welcome to the Final Projects Website

This site features a collection of projects that have been completed as part of the "Python for Data Science" course at Hactiv8. Each project has its own page, where the application of the machine learning model that was implemented can be used.

## Overview of Projects

- **Project 1: 🚕 Predicting Lyft and Uber Price** - This project uses the Linear Regression algorithm to predict the prices for Lyft and Uber rides based on factors such as distance, cab type, etc. 

- **Project 2: 🌧️ Predicting Tomorrow's Rain** -  This project uses the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on various factors such as location, today weather, etc.

- **Project 3: 💔 Predicting Heart Failure Risk** - This project uses the XGBoost algorithm to predict the risk of heart failure in individuals.

- **Project 4: 💳 Clustering Credit Card User** - This project uses the K-means clustering algorithm to group credit card users into different clusters based on their spending habits and other relevant characteristics.
